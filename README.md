## Setting up workspace / compile the mod yourself

If you would like to set up the workspace yourself to submit PRs of features additions or bug fixes, or compile the mod, here's how you do it.

1. Clone the mod.
    - HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/JackyyTV/IntegrationForegoing.git`
    - SSH: `git clone git@github.com:JackyyTV/IntegrationForegoing.git`
    - Or, use the GitHub desktop app to clone the repo via GUI interface.

2. Setting up the workspace, simply import the project to the IDE of your choice, then run `gradlew genEclipseRuns` or `gradlew genIntellijRuns` depending on the need.

3. Either use `gradlew build` to build the jar file (Output is in `build/libs`), or proceed in the IDE if you are going to modify any codes.
